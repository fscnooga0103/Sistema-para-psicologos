# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Soy un psicólogo que quisiera un sistema autogestionable al que pueda acceder siempre ya sea desde mi computadora o desde mi celular. En el sistema quiero poder ver mis pacientes y su historia clínica (Con Datos personales; Estructura familiar; Motivo de la consulta; Hábitos de alimentación, higiene, sueño, independencia; Conducta; HIstoria Educativa; Relaciones Familiares; Antecedentes Familiares; Obseervaciones), así como su evaluación y su avance en el proceso que he planteado para ellos en relación a semanas y logros. Además quisiera ver mi agenda, en la cual debo poder revisar tanto el día como la hora de la cita que previamente se debe haber ingresado. Finalmente, cuando ingrese a la cita del paciente, poder ver qué está propuesto para la sesión, que logros se han alcanzado y proponer también acciones que se deben realizar en la próxima semana. Quisiera que al seleccionar a cada paciente tenga la historia clínica y el avance, teniendo una barra lateral retractitl que me permita siempre acceder a la evaluación, el diagnóstico presuntivo, y hacer anotaciones acerca del paciente. Finalmente, quisiera que mi sistema pudiera integrar los cobros que realizo y cuál es mi ganancia, día a día, semana a semana, mes a mes. El dashboard debe ser interactivo llevando a cada modulo. Debe estar listo para utilizar en un sitio web.

During comprehensive UI testing, login with admin@psychologyportal.com/admin123 initially works and dashboard loads showing 4 patients (Juan Pérez, Rene Montalvo, Edgar Rodriguez). However, session expires unexpectedly during navigation, preventing access to patient management and anamnesis functionality. Backend endpoints are responding correctly (verified with curl), but frontend authentication state is not persistent. This confirms user's report that anamnesis creation is not working. Issue appears to be in frontend authentication/session management rather than anamnesis form itself. AnamnesisForm component exists and is properly implemented with all 13 sections, but users cannot reach it due to authentication issues."
